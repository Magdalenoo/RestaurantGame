# RestaurantGame

#### Description:
RestaurantGame is a simple terminal text-based game/restaurant visiting simulator that isn't necessarily a good restaurant.
You can hear the waiters talking about you, the chef swearing in the kitchen, and the quality of the food you get will literally be a lottery.
This project was created out of the need to learn OOP in C++ and I'm not sure if it will be continued or even completed. Though the idea seems funny.
